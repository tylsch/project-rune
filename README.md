# Project Rune
Collection of projects I have put together to deepen my skills across various frameworks, architectures, methodologies, and technologies.  The repository and project naming scheme follows various names from the Suikoden games (which was my favorite video game series :smiley:).  Below is a breakdown of all the projects in this repository followed by a brief summary.
